# Xinput Support for Mobox and DarkOS

This repository provides Xinput support for Mobox and DarkOS. Please note that this is the initial test version, so not everything may work perfectly. I will continue to work on improving it and welcome any suggestions for enhancement.

## Acknowledgements

I want to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who encouraged me to implement this feature. This is just the beginning, as ynixt rightly said: "I know.. is ugly, but this can be the start of a great idea :)".

Special thanks to ynixt for the initial idea. You can find more details about the inception of this project in the following link: [ynixt's comment](https://github.com/olegos2/mobox/issues/125#issuecomment-1987031399).

I would also like to extend my thanks to brunodev85 for providing the Wine libraries from Winlator. You can explore the Wine patches at [brunodev85/winlator](https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator/tree/main/wine_patches/dlls).

Additionally, I utilized AndroidIDE for building most of the components. You can check out AndroidIDE at [AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE).

## Installation Instructions

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ WARNING ⚠️⚠️⚠️

After installing the DLLs below, any game will only work if xinputbridge is open.  If it is closed the game meight not Start. This is an expected behavior of the current version.
it's recommended to use a separate container, apparently on DarkOS wine8.18 wow64 is more stable.

if this bothers you we recommend that you wait for the next version.


### Mobox:

Copy 32-bit files to: `usr/glibc/<wine_version>/lib/wine/i386-windows`

Copy 64-bit files to: `usr/glibc/<wine_version>/lib/wine/x86_64-windows`

*Note: Replace `<wine_version>` with the appropriate wine version. Currently, it might be "wine-9.3-vanilla-wow64".

You can also install all directly by termux:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
```console
cp -r /storage/emulated/0/Download/winefiles/winefiles/32/* $PREFIX/glibc/<wine_version>/lib/wine/i386-windows
cp -r /storage/emulated/0/Download/winefiles/winefiles/64/* $PREFIX/glibc/<wine_version>/lib/wine/x86_64-windows
```

### DarkOS:

Copy 32-bit files to: `usr/glibc/opt/wine/<container_version>/wine/lib/wine_i386-windows`

Copy 64-bit files to: `usr/glibc/opt/wine/<container_version>/wine/lib/wine/x86_64-windows`

*Note: Replace `<container_version>` with the appropriate container version.

## Compatibility

This implementation has been tested on Redmagic 8S Pro with Android 13 with Xbox One and Gamesir X2 gamepad. Bluetooth connectivity should work, although it hasn't been tested yet.
Any gamepad recognized by Android should work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### With this is possible to play with gamepad any game?

The game needs to be compatible with XInput. Generally speaking, all modern games are compatible, but older games, like NFSU2, need a patch for that.

### Can I use L2/R2 as triggers instead of buttons?

For now this isn't supported as can be readed on [#2](https://github.com/Ilan12346-maya/XinputBridge/issues/2).
